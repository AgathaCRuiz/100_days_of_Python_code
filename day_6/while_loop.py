# differences between for loop and while loop

list_of_items =[]

for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something to each item
    print("something")

#for number in range(a, b):
for number in range(1, 10):
    print(number)


#but while loop...

#w while something_is_true:
    #Do something repeatedly
